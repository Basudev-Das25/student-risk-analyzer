# 🎓 Student Risk Analyzer (Random Forest ML Project)

This project is a machine learning–based academic risk prediction system that classifies students into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** risk categories based on study behavior and academic performance indicators.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, multi-class classification using Random Forest, model evaluation, explainability through feature importance, and deployment readiness.
