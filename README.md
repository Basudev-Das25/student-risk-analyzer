# student-risk-analyzer
Random Forest–based ML application to predict student academic risk levels using behavioral and performance data.

Student Risk Analyzer – Random Forest Classification

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that classifies students into Low, Medium, or High academic risk using a Random Forest classifier. The project demonstrates supervised multi-class classification, feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment-ready architecture for real-world ML applications.

# 🎓 Student Risk Analyzer (Random Forest ML Project)

This project is a machine learning–based academic risk prediction system that classifies students into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** risk categories based on study behavior and academic performance indicators.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, multi-class classification using Random Forest, model evaluation, explainability through feature importance, and deployment readiness.
